Be my girl, I'll be your man
I whispered underneath my breath
I have faith in what I see
You look so beautiful in white, yeah yeah
we don't trust in him
With all my heart I mean every word
Although my heart is falling too
This day I'll cherish
You see her when you close your eyes
You're all that I believe in
I may be crazy, don't mind me
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
'Cause love comes slow, and it goes so fast
Well, now they know
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
I'm free
I will not give you up this time
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
I'll walk her down the aisle
I hope she has your eyes
You'll never see me cry
Yeah, and if she falls in love, we'll let her go
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
But you heard it
Will have and hold you
I found the one and
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Turn away and slam the door
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Let it go, let it go
I know we'll be alright this time
Not knowing what it was
A kingdom of isolation
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
Listening to our favorite song
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
And you let her go
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
My life had found its missing piece
And it looks like I'm the queen
But dreams come slow, and they go so fast
'Cause you loved her too much, and you dived too deep
Barefoot on the grass
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Fighting against all odds
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
My power flurries through the air into the ground
We push and pull like a magnet do
Come, come on now, follow my lead
When you said you looked a mess
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
And with this ring I
I see my future in your eyes
Not a footprint to be seen
I got so nervous I couldn't speak
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
i know him in april
I don't care what they're going to say
And from now 'til my very last breath
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
So the bar is where I go
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
And if a daughter is what our future holds
Well, you let her go
I'm in love with your body
Be the good girl you always have to be
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
So as long as I live I love you
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
Last night you were in my room
Here I stand in the light of day
in case of
Only know you love her when you let her go
Say to the world
So beautiful in white
But never to touch and never to keep
One week in we let the story begin
You look so beautiful in white
Don't let them in, don't let them see
your lie in april
Now I know I have met an angel in person
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
Same old empty feeling in your heart
But when we first met
Tonight
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Your heart is all I own
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
To test the limits and break through
And she looks perfect
And how your family is doing okay
Maybe one day, you'll understand why
Oh, oh, uh, uh
But you only need the light when it's burning low
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Every day discovering something brand new
My love is endless
With you between my arms
In that very moment
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
What we have is timeless
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Will haven and hold you
I'm in love with the shape of you
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Girl, you know I want your love
That perfect girl is gone
Finds love like you and I did
Not sure if you know this
I found a love, for me
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Everything you touch surely dies
Here I stand and here I stay
Can't hold it back anymore
Oh, oh, mm, oh
It's time to see what I can do
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And now my bedsheets smell like you
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
She'll look so beautiful in white, yeah yeah
Listening to our favourite song
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
I am one with the wind and sky
Na na na na
To carry love, to carry children of our own
You look perfect tonight
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
We're going out on our first date
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
You're my every reason
Come on now, follow my lead
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Darling, just hold my hand
But darling, just kiss me slow
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
